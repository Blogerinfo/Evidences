    <h2 style="color: green;">Oral Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      The term oral signifies by word of mouth.Oral evidence means all
      statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by
      witnesses in relation to matter of fact under enquiry. All facts other
      than the contents of a document may be proved by oral evidence and it
      should be directly seen,heard,sense or opinion of witnesses.Evidentiary
      value is much less satisfactory medium of proof when compared to
      documentary proof. section 59 and 60 defines proof of facts by oral
      evidence and oral evidence must be direct.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: green;">Documentary Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      The word document is defined in section 3 of Indian Evidence Act 1872
      “Document means any matter expressed or described upon any substance by
      means of letters, figures, or marks, or by more than one of those means,
      intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording
      that matter”Documents therefore include all such things containing any
      writing or inscription, which the court on their production can read for
      itself.For example a writing on a paper is a document and also in wall
      ,trees on which human thoughts are expressed.Documentary evidences can be
      classified into two type primary evidences and secondary evidences
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Primary Evidence</h2>
    <p>Primary evidence which is produced for the inspection of the court
      should be the original document .An original document is the first permanent
      record of a transaction .This evidence is considered to be best
      evidences.section 62 defines primary evidence means the document itself
      produced for the inspection of the court.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">secondary evidence</h2>
    <p>Secondary evidence is copy of original document,which may be produced to
      court only in absence of primary evidences.This evidences have less
      evidentiary value and not admissible easily in court.section 63 explains
      five kinds of secondary evidence,they are;
      <ul>
        <li>Certified copied</li>
        <li>
          Copies made from the original by mechanical processes and copies
          compared with such copies
        </li>
        <li>Copies made from or compared with the original</li>
        <li>
          Counterparts of the documents as against the parties who did not
          execute them
        </li>
        <li>
          Oral account of the contents of a document by a person who has seen it
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Real Evidence</h2>
    <p>Real evidence is tangible and physical evidence,it is a material fact
      brought to the knowledge of court by inspection. It is not by the
      information collected by the witnesses or documents. It is evidence that
      the court can examine for itself.However, such evidence needs to be
      supported by a witness, preferably an expert opinion who can explain the
      significance of evidence.Real evidence can be ,Material object means the
      weapons used for muder,Photographs,Video recordings,Out of court
      inspection,Forensic evidence,Person’s behaviour and appearance.</p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Judicial Evidence</h2>
    <p>The evidences which is given before the magistrate is said to be judicial
      evidence.But this does not cover the arguments of counsels in the
      court.such evidence can be a confession made by accused in the court or in
      front of judge is judicial evidence,statement of witnesses in a court of
      law and documentary evidence and facts presented for examination by the
      court.</p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Non Judicial Evidence</h2>
    <p>The evidence which is given outside the court and not in front of the
      magistrate is said to be non judicial evidence.for example the confession
      made to any other person then the magistrate.</p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Circumstantial Evidence</h2>
    <p>circumstantial evidence is the statement by witness as to the
      circumstances from which an conclusion is to be drawn as to the fact in
      issue.Circumstantial evidence means an inference to connect it to a
      conclusion of fact.There is not much difference between direct and
      circumstantial evidence,in direct evidence establishes the guilt of the
      accused whereas in circumstantial evidence it leads to an irresistible
      inference of the guilt.when there is no direct evidence available then
      circumstantial evidence is restored.</p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">Hearsay Evidence</h2>
    <p>Hearsay evidence means an evidence which is heard or said,it is called
      as second hand evidence or unoriginal evidence.hearsay evidence does not
      carry much evidentiary value.sectio 60 prohibits hearsay evidence from
      being offered in judicial proceedings subject to the exceptions provided
      in the evidence act.
